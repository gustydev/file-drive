Shopping cart project

main page (includes shop)
checkout

main page is just a simple text and a button with a nice background image
shop page: display items
for each item have the title, price, an option to raise amount to purchase and a add to cart button
and an image of course for the item
checkout/cart: display items bought and total amount. after clicking buy, just reset the thing and display a nice message
bonus: individual pages for each item (generated on the fly i suppose? router string fill thing /:)

fakestoreapi: electronics (name the store Kaboom in reference to that one brazilian store lmao. Logo is a bomb emoji)
add a cool orange and black design to it

test the app too:
check if adding to cart works, check if deleting from cart works etc etc

components:
Main
Shop
Cart

state needs to be shared among them (the items bought)
